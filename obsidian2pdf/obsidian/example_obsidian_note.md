# Obsidian Example Note

This is an example note showing how Obsidian wiki-links work and how they will be converted.

## Wiki Links

In Obsidian, you can create links to other notes like this:
- Simple link: [[Background]]
- Link with custom text: [[Background|theoretical background]]
- Link to section: [[Methodology#data-analysis]]

## Images

Images in Obsidian can be included like this:
![[sample-image.png]]

Or with custom alt text:
![[sample-image.png|My Sample Image]]

## Citations

For citations, you should use standard LaTeX citations in your Obsidian notes:
According to Smith \cite{smith2023}, this approach has several advantages.

Multiple citations can be grouped \cite{smith2023, johnson2022}.
