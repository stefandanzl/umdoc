# Obsidian Directory

Place your Obsidian Markdown files in this directory. These files can use Obsidian's wiki-style links:
- `[[Link]]` - Simple link to another note
- `[[Link|Display Text]]` - Link with custom text
- `![[image.png]]` - Image link

When you're ready to convert these files for use with umdoc, use the conversion scripts in the `../conversion/` directory.
